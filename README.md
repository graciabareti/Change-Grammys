# Change-Grammys 
Using Netlify, successfully created a site using data collected on Grammy Award Winners and Billboard Chart results from 1999-2019, to discuss how the music 
industry is so heavily influenced by Black artists yet doesn't award nor acknowledge Black artists to the calliber that they deserve.
